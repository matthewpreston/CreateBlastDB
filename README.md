# CreateBlastDB
Aggregating Multiple Databases

Have you ever gotten tired of looking up NCBI's sparse yet convoluted tutorials on using utilities such as <strong>makeblastdb</strong> and <strong>blastdb_aliastool</strong>? Well how about being fatigued by merging multiple BLAST databases together? Or gathering all genes from a certain phylogenetic clade? Fret no further because I have encountered all of these problems (and a few more) and decided to do something about it. This is my solution.
